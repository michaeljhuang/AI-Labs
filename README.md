# AI-Labs
All Projects from TJ's Artificial Intelligence Course
These projects were completed during the 2017-2018 school year.

Within these projects, I have:
Used decision trees and other neural networks to make predictions
Created optimal AIs to play games such as Othello or Tic-Tac-Toe
Implemented many searches and used them to quickly implement real world networks
